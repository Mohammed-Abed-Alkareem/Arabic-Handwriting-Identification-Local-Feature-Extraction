# Arabic Handwritten Text Identification Using Local Feature Extraction Techniques

This project focuses on identifying Arabic handwritten text using local feature extraction methods like SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features). The implementation evaluates the performance of these techniques based on accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

## Objective
The goal is to explore and implement local feature extraction methods for identifying handwritten Arabic text and compare their performance. Key objectives include:
- Extracting features using SIFT and SURF.
- Using the Bag of Words (BoW) model to convert descriptors into feature vectors.
- Training a classifier to identify handwritten text based on extracted features.
- Comparing the performance of SIFT and SURF algorithms.

---

## Dataset
We use the **AHAWP dataset** (Arabic Handwritten Automatic Word Processing), which contains:
- 10 unique Arabic words.
- Handwritten samples by 82 individuals, with 10 samples per word.
- A total of 8,144 word images.

The dataset can be downloaded from the [official AHAWP dataset page](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/2h76672znt/1).

## Features
- **Feature Extraction:** Implements SIFT and SURF for local feature detection.
- **Bag of Words Model:** Converts variable-length descriptors into fixed-size feature vectors using K-Means clustering.
- **Classification:** Uses SVM for handwritten word classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Measures accuracy, execution time, robustness, and the number of detected key points.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `opencv-contrib-python`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `torch`
  - `torchvision`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/arabic-handwritten-text-identification.git
   cd arabic-handwritten-text-identification
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

### 1. Preprocess the Dataset
- Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
- Organize the images into train and test splits as required.

### 2. Run Feature Extraction and Training
Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Evaluate and Visualize Results
- The script outputs performance metrics and visualizations of keypoints and predictions.

---

## Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate SIFT and SURF based on:
1. **Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly classified test samples.
2. **Time Efficiency:** Execution time for feature extraction and matching.
3. **Robustness:** Performance under variations in scale, rotation, illumination, and noise.
4. **Number of Key Points:** Total key points detected for each method.

---

## Results
### Sample Results
- **Accuracy:** SIFT - 90.5%, SURF - 85.3%
- **Execution Time:** SIFT - 3.2s/image, SURF - 2.1s/image
- **Robustness:** SIFT performs better under rotation, while SURF is more efficient in scaling.

Detailed results and visualizations can be found in the `results/` directory.
