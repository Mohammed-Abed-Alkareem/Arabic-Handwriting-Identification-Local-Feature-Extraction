# Arabic Handwritten Text Identification Using Local Feature Extraction Techniques

This project focuses on identifying Arabic handwritten text using local feature extraction methods like SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and ORB(Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF). The implementation evaluates the performance of these techniques based on accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

## Objective

The goal is to explore and implement local feature extraction methods for identifying handwritten Arabic text and compare their performance. Key objectives include:

- Extracting features using SIFT and ORB.
- Using the Bag of Words (BoW) model to convert descriptors into feature vectors.
- Training a classifier to identify handwritten text based on extracted features.
- Comparing the performance of SIFT and ORB algorithms.

## Dataset

We use the **AHAWP dataset** (Arabic Handwritten Automatic Word Processing), which contains:

- 10 unique Arabic words.
- Handwritten samples by 82 individuals, with 10 samples per word.
- A total of 8,144 word images.

The dataset can be downloaded from the [official AHAWP dataset page](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/2h76672znt/1/files/9031138a-b812-433e-a704-8acb1707936e).
